EcoCampus addresses a critical gap in student engagement with environmental sustainability. While universities increasingly prioritize green initiatives, students often lack awareness of their personal environmental impact and have limited motivation to change their daily habits. The problem is twofold: students don't have accessible tools to track their sustainable actions, and there's no competitive or social element to make sustainability engaging and rewarding.

Our solution is a mobile gamification platform that transforms sustainability into an engaging, measurable, and social experience. Students log eco-friendly actions across categories like digital consumption, transportation, energy usage, and waste management. Each action contributes points calculated using published research data on CO2 and energy consumption, ensuring credibility and educational value. The platform features university-specific leaderboards that reset monthly, creating ongoing competitive motivation while allowing students to track their personal environmental progress over time.

The unique value proposition centers on making sustainability both competitive and credible. Unlike generic habit-tracking apps, EcoCampus combines research-backed impact calculations with university-specific social dynamics, creating a sense of community ownership over environmental goals. Universities can register their students, who then choose between private personal tracking or joining their university's competitive leaderboard, ensuring flexibility for different user preferences.

Key success metrics include:

Weekly Active Users (WAU) and retention rates

Average actions logged per user per week

Total CO2 reduction calculated across the platform

Number of universities and students participating

Month-over-month growth in user engagement

The platform measures overall environmental impact while enabling universities to compare their sustainability metrics, fostering healthy inter-institutional competition. Revenue potential exists through university partnerships, institutional licensing for campus-wide programs, and potential sponsorships from eco-friendly brands interested in reaching environmentally conscious students. The cost structure remains lean, primarily covering development, cloud hosting via Supabase, and marketing materials for campus outreach.
